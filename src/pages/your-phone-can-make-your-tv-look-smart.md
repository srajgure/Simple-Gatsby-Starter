Does anyone watch network TV any more? The evening news is about it for me, and then the commercials drive me crazy. When I want entertainment I get it from streaming services like Netflix, HBO Go or Amazon Prime. Sometimes I even get my news from streaming services like YouTube, CBS, or PBS. But, how to accomplish this? I don’t have a smart TV, but I do have a Chromecast on the TV which means I can bring up a show on my computer or phone and “cast” it to the TV as long as the TV input is set to the correct HDMI port.

During this pandemic, #StayHome time, I’ve been watching a lot of Netflix and I’ve learned that my phone is actually the best way to stream shows and cast to the TV. I have a Netflix account and the Netflix app on my phone. I have an Amazon Prime account and the Prime Video app on my phone, and, of course I have the YouTube app on my phone. With any of these apps, I can happily watch shows on my phone, but it just takes one tap on the Cast button and now the show is on my big screen TV, the sound is coming out of our surround sound speakers and both my husband and I can be comfortable on the couch and watch the show. If I need to pause, just tap the screen on the phone.

It’s like having the phone as a remote control, but you’re not controlling television functions, you’re controlling the programming. The TV just provides the screen and the speakers.
